# noclip
An HTML5 game made with Javascript and Phaser 3, with a Rails API backend.

Demo deployed here: https://smilevideo.github.io/noclip-frontend/

Use your energy to phase through any obstacles to reach the end, but be careful: if you return to material form on top of an obstacle, you will perish!
